This project is designed for making a program that plays the game 'siete y medio' agaisnt the player.
The program displays player's money and asks for bet. A round of game consist of a card being drawn for the player and the dealer respectively.  The player is then asked if he needs another card (response y/n).  After the player is done, dealer would draw a new card if the card total is under 5.5.  The winning/losing condition is as followed.  
If player's number is larger than dealer's number, or dealer busted while player didnt, then player wins.
Else if player's number is smaller than dealer's number, or player busted, then dealer wins.
Else if both player and dealer busted, dealer wins.
Else if both player and dealer have the same number, then they tie.
